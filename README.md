## Developer Steps to Create a Console Application

### Virtual Environment Setup

We will be using a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies in this project.

1. First, we need to install `venv` so we can work in a virtual environment. Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```python -m venv venv```

### Authorizing Script Execution

To enable script execution, we need to authorize access using the following command:

1. Open another terminal and execute the following command:
```Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

To activate our virtual environment and start working with the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a new terminal.

2. Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:
```& .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```

With the virtual environment set up and activated, you are ready to work on your console application.

Feel free to modify the above steps based on your specific requirements or project setup.
