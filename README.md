## Developer Guide: Creating a Console Application

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a console application using Python.

### 1. Virtual Environment Setup

To isolate the dependencies of the project, we will use a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set it up:

- Open a terminal and execute the following command to install `venv`:

```python -m venv venv```

### 2. Authorizing Script Execution

To enable script execution, you need to authorize access. Follow these steps:

- Open another terminal and execute the following command:

```Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass```

### 3. Activating the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment and start working on the project, follow these steps:

- Open a new terminal.

- Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```& .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```


With the virtual environment set up and activated, you are now ready to develop your console application.

Feel free to modify the above steps based on your specific requirements or project setup.

## Data Storage

For this project, we will utilize a `.json` file to store all the data generated by the application. However, you can choose alternative file formats such as CSV or Excel (.xls) if preferred.

### Viewing the Objects in the .json File

To view the objects stored in the `.json` file, execute the following command:
```python cli.py user```
